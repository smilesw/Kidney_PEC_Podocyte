# Kidney_PEC_podocyte
Podocyte loss is a key pathogenic event in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), yet effective therapies that specifically target this process are still lacking. This research aimed to understand podocyte regeneration under physiological conditions and podocyte phenotypic alterations in DKD at single-cell resolution. Through integrative multi-omic analyses across mice and humans, we established a conserved molecular framework governing podocyte homeostasis in health and disease. Our analyses identified six distinct subpopulations, spanning PECs and podocytes, each with a unique transcriptional and regulatory profile. Trajectory analysis revealed a sequential transition among these subpopulations, including a biphasic phenotypic shift in DKD. Our findings provide a comprehensive landscape of cellular dynamics from PECs to podocytes, which could facilitate the development of podocyte-targeted therapeutic strategies.
