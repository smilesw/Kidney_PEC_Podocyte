# Kidney_PEC_podocyte
 Through integrative multi-omic analyses across mice and humans, we established a conserved molecular framework governing podocyte homeostasis in normal and diabetic kidneys. Our findings provide a comprehensive landscape of cellular dynamics from PECs to podocytes, which could facilitate the development of podocyte-targeted therapeutic strategies.
